# Contributing to Markup Survival

## Current Development Status

**Markup Survival is currently a 100% solo project during initial development phase.**

This project is being developed solo to maintain focus on core survival mechanics and discovery-based learning systems. External contributions are not being accepted at this time.

## Why Solo Development?

### Focus & Vision Consistency
- **Unified Vision**: Ensuring survival-focused gameplay remains central
- **Discovery Balance**: Fine-tuning the experimentation vs documentation balance
- **Rapid Iteration**: Making quick design decisions without consensus overhead
- **Core Mechanics**: Establishing solid foundation before external input

### Educational Design Philosophy
- **Minimal Documentation**: Intentionally sparse documentation to encourage discovery
- **Console-First Interaction**: JavaScript interface design requires careful consideration
- **Survival Pressure**: Balancing challenge with learning opportunity requires focused testing

## Future Community Involvement

### Post-MVP Contributions
Once the core survival mechanics and discovery systems are established:

- **Content Creation**: New entities, recipes, and survival scenarios
- **Advanced Features**: Complex crafting chains and environmental systems
- **Educational Tools**: Structured lessons using survival scenarios
- **Bug Reports**: Testing and feedback on discovery balance

### Areas for Future Contribution
- **Survival Scenarios**: Creative survival challenges
- **Discovery Content**: New class interactions and crafting recipes  
- **Educational Integration**: Connecting gameplay to web development concepts
- **Community Tools**: Sharing discoveries and survival strategies

## Current Development Approach

### Solo Development Principles
- **Survival-First**: Every feature must serve survival gameplay
- **Discovery-Driven**: Players learn through experimentation, not documentation
- **Minimal Hand-Holding**: Game teaches through necessity, not tutorials
- **Code-as-Documentation**: Advanced strategies discoverable through source inspection

### Development Process
- **Iterative Testing**: Build feature, test survival impact, refine
- **Discovery Validation**: Ensure logical combinations are findable
- **Survival Balance**: Maintain challenge without frustration
- **Educational Value**: Reinforce web development concepts through gameplay

## Following Development Progress

### Stay Updated
- **GitHub Releases**: Track major development milestones
- **Documentation Updates**: Watch for concept and phase updates
- **Demo Builds**: Test early versions when available

### Providing Feedback (Currently Welcome)
While contributions aren't accepted, feedback is valuable:

#### Survival Balance Feedback
- Is the survival pressure appropriate?
- Are discovery mechanics intuitive?
- Does the console interface feel natural?

#### Educational Value Feedback  
- Are web development concepts clearly reinforced?
- Is the learning curve appropriate?
- Does discovery feel rewarding rather than frustrating?

#### Discovery System Feedback
- Are logical combinations discoverable?
- Is the hint system helpful without being hand-holding?
- Do failed experiments provide useful feedback?

### How to Provide Feedback
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and balance feedback
- **GitHub Discussions**: Educational design feedback
- **Playtesting**: When demo builds become available

## Technical Standards (For Future Reference)

### Code Quality Expectations
```typescript
// Example entity implementation
interface SurvivalEntity {
  id: string
  type: EntityType
  classes: string[]
  properties: EntityProperties
  survivalValue: number
  discoverable: boolean
}
```

### Discovery Design Principles
- **Logical Naming**: CSS classes follow real-world intuition
- **Clear Feedback**: Failed combinations explain why they don't work
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple recipes lead to complex discoveries
- **Code Transparency**: Advanced mechanics visible in source code

### Educational Integration
- **Web Development Concepts**: Every game mechanic reinforces coding skills
- **Real-World Patterns**: Game architecture mirrors professional development
- **Problem-Solving**: Survival pressure encourages creative technical solutions

## Development Tools & Environment

### Current Stack
- **Framework**: Nuxt 3
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Development**: Modern web technologies

### Development Environment
```bash
# Setup for future contributors
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markup-survival.git
cd markup-survival
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Testing Approach
- **Survival Testing**: Ensure player dies without skillful actions
- **Discovery Testing**: Validate logical combinations are findable
- **Educational Testing**: Confirm web development concepts are reinforced
- **Balance Testing**: Maintain challenge without frustration

## Future Contribution Guidelines

### When Contributions Open

#### Content Contributions
- **New Entities**: Follow predefined class system
- **Survival Scenarios**: Create challenging but fair survival situations
- **Discovery Content**: Add logical crafting combinations
- **Educational Content**: Connect gameplay to learning objectives

#### Code Contributions
- **TypeScript Required**: Type safety for all code
- **Discovery-Focused**: Features must encourage experimentation
- **Survival-Relevant**: All features must serve survival gameplay
- **Educational Value**: Code should teach through example

#### Documentation Contributions
- **Minimal Philosophy**: Maintain sparse documentation approach
- **Discovery Encouragement**: Guide experimentation, not hand-hold
- **Code Examples**: Show patterns, don't explain everything
- **Survival Focus**: Emphasize life-or-death stakes

### Code Review Standards (Future)
- **Survival Impact**: Does this feature create meaningful survival choices?
- **Discovery Value**: Can players figure this out through experimentation?
- **Educational Merit**: Does this teach web development concepts?
- **Code Quality**: Is this production-ready TypeScript?

## Communication

### Project Philosophy
- **Survival Through Code**: Programming skills are essential for survival
- **Discovery Over Documentation**: Learn by doing, not reading
- **Real Consequences**: Mistakes have survival costs
- **Educational Priority**: Web development learning through gameplay

### Design Decisions
All current design decisions prioritize:
1. **Survival Urgency**: Life-or-death stakes drive engagement
2. **Discovery Mechanics**: Experimentation reveals game systems
3. **Console Interface**: JavaScript commands for all interactions
4. **Educational Value**: Reinforcing web development skills

## Summary

Markup Survival is currently developed solo to establish core survival mechanics and discovery systems. While contributions aren't accepted during initial development, feedback on survival balance, discovery mechanics, and educational value is welcome.

The project will open to community contributions after the MVP is complete and core systems are proven effective for survival-based learning.

**Current Focus**: Building a game where coding skills are essential for survival, not just helpful for exploration.
